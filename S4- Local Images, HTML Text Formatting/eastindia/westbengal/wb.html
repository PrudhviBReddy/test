    <p>Make a mental note, Bengalis love poppy seeds. They really do and why won't they, it makes food so much tastier! This preparation above is also made of poppy or Posto as the Bengalis like to call it. It is a preparation of Posto with potatoes and pointed gourd, complete with red and green chillies and sometimes coconut puree to add some much-needed spice to it. It truly is one of the classic Bengali dishes and famous food of West Bengal!</p>
    <h2>Butterscotch Ice Cream</h2>

    <p>The most popular sweet from the Bengali state, this dish is made of khoya, a version of condensed milk and is heavenly in taste. This sweet is neither overly sweet thus allowing people with a non-sweet tooth to enjoy too. One should definitely try this delectable West Bengal food item.</p>
    <h2>Keri Ka Sharbat</h2>

    <p>A drink made of chilled water, burnt raw mangoes and sugar, it is an instant relief that you will get on a sweltering summer afternoon (and with the Kolkata heat you might as well require it). The raw mangoes are burnt, but only partially, with the skin a bit charred which lends a smoky taste to the drink. Best served chilled; this drink is surely the one which is more relaxing and refreshing than the colas with artificial sweetness.</p>
